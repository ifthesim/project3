The app is called GreenRush will be awareness application which will be totally focused on sustainable energy and recycle product users. The user will be able to post their stories and pictures as a pin and people can actually up vote them if they like the pin. Lets say for example I have a Tesla, I use solar power on my roof top and I have a window garden built on recycled plastic bottle where I grow oranges. I will post the pin of all three things and other people can have a look at my way of green living and up vote my pin on the application and create more awareness and learn more for what I am doing. Through the app people will be able to explore new ideas of green living and contribute to the app later after they get inspired for these amazing ideas of so many users.
